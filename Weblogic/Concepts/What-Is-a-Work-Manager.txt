A Work Manager helps you manage the WebLogic Server instance workload, specifically by letting you prioritize work execution, which you do by defining request classes and constraints. 
You can configure a Work Manager at the domain level (using a global Work Manager) or at the application or module level.

Services
Following are some of the main services used in a WebLogic environment:
a.	JDBC (Java Database Connectivity) enables Java programs to handle database connections established through connection pools.
b.	JMS (Java Messaging Service) is a standard API that enables applications to communicate	through enterprise messaging systems.
c.	JTA (Java Transaction API) specifies standard Java interfaces between transaction managers and the parties in a distributed transaction system.
