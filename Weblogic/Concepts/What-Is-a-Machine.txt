A machine in the WebLogic Server context is the logical representation of the computer that hosts one or more WebLogic Server instances (servers). The Admin Server uses the machine definitions that you create to start remote servers through the Node Managers that run on those servers. 
A machine could be a physical or virtual server that hosts an Admin or Managed Server that belongs to a domain. You must define a machine first if you want the Admin Server to use the Node Manager service to monitor, start, and stop the Managed Servers running on a server. 
In a sense, a machine in a WebLogic Server environment is more or less equivalent to an instance of a Node Manager, and this is essentially the concept that a machine represents. WebLogic clusters make use of the machines you define in order to decide the optimal way to replicate session data on a different server that is part of a cluster.
