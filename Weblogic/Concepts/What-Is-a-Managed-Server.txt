Managed Servers are the workhorses of WebLogic Server. Any additional servers you create after the creation of the default Admin Server are Managed Servers. The Managed Server contacts the Admin Server upon startup, to get its configuration and deployment settings. For this reason, you should always start the Admin Server before you start a Managed Server. 
	Once a Managed Server starts running, it operates completely independently from the Admin Server.
	
Although you can deploy a Java EE application to the Admin Server itself, the recommended approach is to deploy applications to the Managed Servers. In a production environment, it’s common to run multiple Managed Servers as part of a cluster. A Managed Server hosts your Java EE applications, as well as all related resources and services such as Java Database Connectivity (JDBC) connection pools and data sources, Java Transaction API (JTA) transaction services, and Java Messaging Service (JMS) connection factories that are necessary to support application deployments.

On startup, a Managed Server contacts the Admin Server to retrieve any configuration changes since the Managed Server was last shut down. A Managed Server can continue to run, however, and it’s even possible to start it in the absence of an Admin Server in the special Managed Server Independence (MSI) mode. The MSI mode is enabled by default, and it allows the Managed Server to start using its locally cached configuration without having to contact the Admin Server for this information.
